The BITREAL coin supports the special AIF of BITREAL Capital with the ERC-20 Token Standard (https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard) based on smart contracts of the Ethereum network (https://ethereum.org).

# Introduction
The BITREAL coin is covered by commercial real estate and uses the ERC-20 token standard of the Ethereum network. The use of this standard ensures that the most widely used token technology is in place today, reducing the total lifecycle management burden from the initial coin offering (ICO) and purchase to completion and sale of each token as much as possible.

The structure of the BITREAL coin consists of the following components:
* BITREALCoin.sol
* BITREALCoinICOCampaign.sol
* BITREALCoinAssetManagement.sol
* BITREALCoinDisburse.sol
* LinearTokenVault.sol
* MiniMeToken.sol

# BITREALCoin.sol

# BITREALCoinICOCampaign.sol
To manage and control the BITREAL coin generation during the ICO runtime.

# BITREALCoinAssetManagement.sol
